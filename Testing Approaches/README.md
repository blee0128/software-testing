# Testing Approaches
- White Box Testing
- Black Box Testing
- Gray Box Testing


## White Box Testing
Definition:
- This is a testing method where the internal workings of the application under test are completely known and visible to the tester.
Focus:
- Emphasizes on checking the internal structures, working, and algorithms of the application.

## Black Box Testing
Definition: 
- This testing method involves testing the software based on its functionalities without any knowledge of its internal code or workings.
Focus: 
- Emphasizes on checking the system's behavior against the specified requirements without bothering about how the system produces that output.

## Grey Box Testing
Definition: 
- Grey Box is a combination of both White Box and Black Box Testing. Here, the tester has partial knowledge of the internal workings of the system.
Focus: 
- Aims to identify defects by leveraging both code-based testing (like in White Box) and functionality testing (like in Black Box).
